# 3.1: Technical Choices

Now that you have understood the importance of privacy, taken initial steps to increase yours and sanitize your online environment, as well as crafted your own threat model, you are ready to start making important technical choices. The tools you'll be using to conduct the activities of your pseudonymous identity are central to the level of privacy and security of that identity, so you want to put great thought into it. Hopefully you have done the hard work already in your threat model, and the correct route you should take here will most likely be obvious.

So before you jump into the cool stuff and create a new identity, you should decide what hardware and software you'll be using. If you haven't already, go take a look at the apendices of this project; they offer good insights into smartphones and computers. [Appendix one](A1_smartphones.md) covers the iOS vs Android debate, and [appendix two](A2_computers.md) provides an overview on computers.

Below are the different routes you can take based on their required dedication of time, money, effort, and skill level, from the least to the most demanding. Have your threat model be the primary consideration you take into account for selecting a route, instead of effort or time. If you get slacky and choose an easier route, but one that doesn't fulfill your threat model entirely, you'll soon find some of your assets or your identity entirely in trouble. Be careful and choose wisely!

- **1. Tor Browser**. You should use the Tor Browser for your pseudonymous identity only if you have absolutely _no time, no money, no technical skills, no effort to allocate, and very limited resources_. The reason is that it will provide the smallest level of protection for you, but is also the easiest to use, as you also would not need to purchase additional hardware. You can simply use the computer you already have, install Tor Browser in it, and use that for your advocacy needs. But beware of the shortcomings of this setup too, notably the limited protection it will give you. Tor usage can be deanonymized based on your non-Tor usage and behaviors, so keep that in mind. This route might make sense depending on your threat model, but _is not recommended._
- **2. Tails**. If you have a larger amount of time and learning motivation, but still have limited resources and can't purchase a dedicated laptop, you might want to use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html). Although [not perfect](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warnings/index.en.html), Tails can help you [protect your digital life from censorship and surveillance](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html) in a somewhat easy way. You can setup a Tails USB stick to temporarily turn your computer into a secure machine or stay safe while using the computer of somebody else. Do note that if used on a compromised machine, for instance, a computer with viruses or malicious hardware, Tails won't _always_ be able to protect you. Considering how difficult it can be to spot some malicious software and hardware in a given device, physical compartmentalization is always a better choice.
- **3. Tails on a dedicated laptop**. If your budget allows it, you might want to purchase a dedicated laptop to use for your sensitive activities over Tor on Tails. You can purchase a used business laptop for cash and install Debian on it for increased privacy and security and lower costs. You can also buy a used MacBook Air from 2012 or 2013 for cheap, reset it, and [harden it for increased security and privacy](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide); then you can use it more safely with Tails. Just make sure you only use this computer for the very specific set of activities your identity needs. _This setup is encouraged and should be sufficient for most people, including human rights activists._
- **4. Whonix or Qubes OS on a dedicated laptop.** The reason for having these two operating systems separately here is because of the increased hardware and system requirements they have. Both [Whonix](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/) and Qubes OS are more demanding to the machine they run on, so you'd need a bigger budget –– and more time and effort –– to set it up. Also reference [this comparison](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others) (onion site [here](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Comparison_with_Others)) to judge which system would be better for your specific case.

## Conclusion

Route 3 is likely to suffice for most use cases, including if you are a human rights activist facing censorship or restrictions from developing countries or mid-tier entities. For further information on how to protect your identity and achieve online anonymity, I recommend you take a careful look at [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity](http://thgtoa7imksbg7rit4grgijl2ef6kc7b56bp56pmtta4g354lydlzkqd.onion/guide.pdf).
