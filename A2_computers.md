# Appendix 2: Computers

Choosing the right computer to use is very important. Generally, you should apply compartmentalization here and use a dedicated computer for your advocacy needs, and again, choose a free and open source software (FOSS) solution. But your setup can vary based on your budget, time, and technical skills.

This appendix provides a simple overview of broad routes that can be taken depending on your computer needs. Specific routes you should take are discussed in Section Three's [Technical Choices for a New Identity](03_1_technical_choices.md).

- A basic starting setup would be to compartmentalize _partially_ and have the Tails operating system in a USB drive for usage with the laptop or computer you already have and use. Tails will route all traffic through the Tor anonymity network as well as strictly compartmentalize storage, getting rid of all data when you turn it off (if in Amnesia mode). If you use Tails exclusively for your new identity's needs, and your regular computer for your real identity, your setup would be considerably secure and private. However, it can be improved.

- A mid-range budget setup entails buying a used laptop for cash and running the Debian Linux distribution on it. Debian is generally more secure and private than Windows and macOS, and therefore using it for your real identity's purposes, if possible, can be beneficial. On top of that, you can have Tails on a USB drive and use that for your advocacy needs.
  - An alternative to Linux is purchasing an used, old Mac in "for parts" condition and using Tails in it. But in this case a model from 2012 and newer is best due to software update availability.

- A better but more expensive setup would be to have one computer exclusively for each use case. For example, having your regular, now sanitized Windows or macOS computer for your real identity's needs; one laptop running Debian for tasks that require greater security and privacy; and a dedicated laptop for the most critical activities running Tails, Whonix, or Qubes OS. But this setup would only work if you don't mix identities with use cases and devices, because your behavior patterns can be used to deanonymize your Tor usage. Also, higher time, effort, and technical dedication are required in this setup.
