# Pseudonymity Guide

This guide aims to provide the reader with a simple yet effective way to create and operate a new pseudonymous identity. Please refer to [Privacy Basics](./privacy-basics.md) first as it contains a basic introduction to privacy, highlighting steps you can take today to diminish the footprint you leave online and reduce the overall risk of falling victim to online doxxing, stalking, coercion, and other undesirable consequences of browsing the internet. After you have taken basic privacy steps, you will be able to create and use a new, pseudonymous identity with this document.

It is important to note that perfect privacy is not practical. Aiming for the perfect setup, one that would allow you to be a true ghost on the internet and unreachable by global, skillful entities with unlimited resources, would require an incredible amount of _daily_ work, effort, and time to achieve –– if it's possible at all. Additionally, striving for the perfect setup will most likely freeze you or lead you to despair once you realize you haven't reached it after countless dedication. So, remember: perfection is the enemy of good.

## Technical Choices

After understanding privacy basics, taking initial steps to increase your online privacy and sanitize your existing identity, and understanding some of the hardware and software choices you have and their tradeoffs, you can now analyze all that and settle on the perfect setup for yourself.

Below are choices you can take based on their required dedication of time, money, effort, and skill level, from the least to the most demanding.

- **Tor Browser**. You should use the Tor Browser for your pseudonymous identity only if you have absolutely _no time, no money, no technical skills, no effort to allocate, and very limited resources_. The reason is that it will provide the smallest level of protection for you, but is also the easiest to use, as you also would not need to purchase additional hardware. You can simply use the computer you already use, install Tor Browser in it, and use that for your advocacy needs. But beware of the shortcomings of this setup too, notably the limited protection it will give you. Tor usage can be deanonymized based on your non-Tor usage and behaviors, so keep that in mind.
- **Tails**. If you have a larger amount of time and learning motivation, but still has limited resources and can't purchase a dedicated laptop, you might want to use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html). Although [not perfect](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warnings/index.en.html), Tails can help you [protect your digital life from censorship and surveillance](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html) in a somewhat easy way. You can setup a Tails USB stick to temporarily turn your computer into a secure machine or stay safe while using the computer of somebody else. Do note that if used on a compromised machine, for instance a computer with viruses or with malicious hardware, like keyloggers, Tails won't _always_ be able to protect you. Considering how difficult it can be to spot some malicious software and hardware in a given device, physical compartmentalization is always a better choice.
- **Tails on a dedicated laptop**. If your budget allows it, you might want to purchase a dedicated laptop to use for your sensitive activities over Tor on Tails. You can purchase a used business laptop for cash and install Debian on it for increased privacy and security and lower costs. You can also buy a used MacBook Air from 2012 or 2013 for cheap, reset it, and [harden it for increased security and privacy](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide); then you can use it more safely with Tails. Just make sure you only use this computer for the very specific set of activities your identity needs.
- **Whonix or Qubes OS on a dedicated laptop.** The reason for having these two operating systems separately here is because of the increased hardware and system specifications they require. Both [Whonix](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/) and Qubes OS are more demanding to the machine they run on, so you'd need a bigger budget –– and more time and effort –– to set it up. Also reference [this comparison](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others) (onion site [here](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Comparison_with_Others)) to judge which system would be better for your specific case.

Please note that depending on your threat model you may be required to go at greater lengths to have full anonymity, including anonymous phone numbers. If that's your case, please reference [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity](http://thgtoa7imksbg7rit4grgijl2ef6kc7b56bp56pmtta4g354lydlzkqd.onion/guide.pdf).

## Create Your New Identity

After you have taken basic yet important steps to increase present privacy, carefully thought about your threat model, and identified where and how you can harden your privacy and security, you can begin the identity creation process.

It is important to define the _scope_ of your new identity. As you've completed the steps above, think about how your identity will interact with the world. More precisely, what will your identity do, through which mediums, with which tools, and when? Having that clear (and often written down) will help you along the way to prevent you from getting distracted.

For the following steps, use the setup you selected in "Technical Choices." At the very least, use the Tor Browser going forward in an internet connection that is not your home's and that has no video footage. All the following steps will assume you're using Tor.

> **Note:** The following steps seem small and simple, however, it may take you a considerable amount of time to go through each one. _You should take your time to complete them right!_ Each tip or mention is worth considering and going through, so be calm and do it right rather than quick.
>
> **On downloads:** Always download through Tor, and always verify your downloads. Below download buttons for software products there is usually a "Verify Signature" or "GPG signature" little icon (or something similar). _Always click on that and go through the steps to verify your download_, otherwise you won't know if you downloaded the correct software or if it was tampered with.

1. **The first thing you need is clean bitcoin**, which you can get in [KYC-free sources](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-five-buying-kyc-free-bitcoin). Find more about it and ways to get it [here](http://lq2thd4kcnqvbm6k47qkt2ctzrfd567ewqeowehgqbekesgvn4npcmid.onion/nokyconly/) and [here](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/). The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity cited above also has a section on this. _Take your time to get clean BTC because this is essential to the remainder steps_. Bitcoin itself is _not_ anonymous, but it can be if you use it with [good practices](https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy) in mind.
   
   - Buy it in batches to [_different_ addresses](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/why-wasabi/AddressReuse.html), because you don't want to deal with change too much, as it can hurt your privacy.
   - Use a good wallet such as [Samourai](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-wallets-for-beginners-part-two-how-to-install-samourai) or [Wasabi](http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/) that uses Tor by default.
   - Both wallets above will [enforce some good practices](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/why-wasabi/) for Bitcoin addresses and transactions, as well as let you [CoinJoin](https://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool) your coins, [increasing your anonymity](https://samouraiwallet.com/privacy) (if you do it right). If you're using Samourai you can also make your spend a CoinJoin to [increase spending privacy](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-use-stonewallx2-a-privacy-enhancing-bitcoin-transaction-tool-from-samourai-wallet) –– which will be important in the next step.
2. **Purchase a good VPN service**. Head over to [Mullvad's onion website](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/en/) and create a new account. This will generate an account number; then, select the amount of time you want to fund your account for and pay with your clean bitcoin. It will help your anonymity to use the full contents of one UTXO for paying Mullvad, because then you wouldn't receive any change. But that may be hard to coordinate, so if not possible to match, just having your change a large amount instead of a negligible one will make it harder for chain analysis companies to spot which is the payment and which is the change.
   
   - After you have paid, [download](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/en/download/) the Mullvad app _only_ to the devices your new identity will be using. Note that it may take a while for your account balance to update and see your payment, due to blockchain confirmations, so be patient.
   - When Mullvad is fully set up on your devices and working, always connect to it for all of the remaining steps. Also connect to it first, then connect to Tor / Tor Browser.
   - You can also go in Mullvad app's `Settings > Advanced > Always Require VPN`, so that if your connection goes down the app will block internet access.
3. **Pick an email provider**, but don't create your account just yet. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is my personal advice, and should be the best choice for most people. But there are other good alternatives as well. You can reference [this page](http://www.privacy2zbidut4m4jyj3ksdqidzkw3uoip2vhvhbvwxbqux5xy5obyd.onion/providers/email/) for choosing a privacy-preserving email provider that best fits your needs.
4. **Search for and pick a pronounceable handle.** Whilst doing everything over Tor (connecting to your VPN first), start thinking on what your new identity's name would be like. Focus on readibility, and it should be pronounceable as well. Search for and pick a handle that:
   
   - Is not already in use by ProtonMail (or the email provider you chose in the previous step).
   - Is not already in use by GitHub.
   - Is not already in use by Twitter (optional).
   - Is not already in use by Gmail (optional).
   - Has a cheap domain name available. Use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) to search for and buy the domain if you wish to do so, since it accepts bitcoin and has some privacy-preserving features enabled automatically as well as some policies for protecting customer rights. This will be especially useful if you need to set up a website for advocacy, a donation page, or something of the sorts.
   
   Alternatively, you can use a full name, instead of a simple handle, with more complete personal details to create a _full_ identity (reference [Fake Name Generator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) for help with this).
5. **Get a new phone number.** You will need it for creating some accounts later on, so do it anonymously if you can: buy a prepaid SIM with cash. That is not possible in some parts of the world, however, since KYC information may be required either to buy it or to set it up. So analyze what is best in your circumstances and considering your threat model. In either case, _do not use your real identity's phone number going forward_.
   
   - If your budget allows it, also get a new phone. In most cases, and to make your identity's Operational Security (OpSec) easier, you can [buy an affordable Pixel 4a with cash and de-google it](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-establish-mobile-bitcoin-privacy-with-a-pixel-4a-and-calyxos) with a security- and privacy-conscious OS, such as Graphene or Calyx. But that may be hard to find in some areas or your skill level may not be there yet, so reference the Android-iOS discussion fleshed out in this guide's intro to decide.
6. **Buy a WebAuthN key** (SmartCard) [for security](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38924/how-does-storing-gpg-ssh-private-keys-on-smart-cards-compare-to-plain-usb-drives). Purchase a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/) in person with cash. You can find resellers near you in their website. If there are none, adjust and purchase by revealing the least amount of personal information you can; notably, you can use a private mail box to prevent disclosing your home address.
7. **Create your email account.** Go to the email provider you selected and create your email account. If they have an onion hidden service, Tor Browser will automatically redirect you so maybe wait a minute after the site has loaded to begin the account creation process.
8. **Generate new GPG keys.** Remember to use your pseudonymous handle and its email as your key's user ID.
   - Follow [this guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) for creating your own keys and establishing a hardened setup with your new YubiKey.
   - Alternatively, if technical skills become a bottleneck, save your YubiKey for later and have your email provider create GPG keys for you (ProtonMail supports this). Although not perfect, it is functional and may be acceptable for some threat models –– and you can generate a new GPG keypair for your identity later when you're more comfortable using it.
9. **Create your GitHub account.** Of course, this assumes you'll need a GitHub account; if you won't, you may skip it. But it doesn't hurt to create one, as you might need it some day. So, [create one](https://github.com/), at least for securing your handle.
   
   - [Add your GPG key to your GitHub account](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS/blob/master/gpg-with-github.md).
10. **[Optional] Create other accounts.** Your new identity might need additional accounts depending on its required activities. Go ahead and create them. Remember to use VPN and Tor for everything and provide the least amount of private information possible. Most service providers will prompt you for _many_ pieces of information but most of it is not _truly necessary_ for account creation. Just beware of that and create it attentively.
    
    - Note: some of your identity needs can be accomplished with similar, more private and secure tools than mainstream ones. For example, you might need a document editing tool and Google Docs might jump out in your head as the go-to service, but often you could use CryptPad instead. Refer to [Privacy Tools](http://www.privacy2zbidut4m4jyj3ksdqidzkw3uoip2vhvhbvwxbqux5xy5obyd.onion/) every time you realize you need to sign up for a new service and evaluate if there's a more private alternative that suits your needs.

Phew! If you performed each and every step with caution and attention, your new identity should now be set and ready to be used. You have a pronounceable handle, a new phone number, an email address, maybe a domain, GPG keys, a YubiKey, and a GitHub account with GPG-commit signing enabled.

## Operate Your New Identity

Your main goal while operating your pseudonymous identity should be to prevent having it be linked back to your real-world identity, because if that happens then all your work goes to waste. There are many techniques you can use to ensure that to the best of your ability, but that can vary depending on your specific circumstances. 

Read more about [privacy](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) and [anonymity](https://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity) to become more aware of the different ways adversaries may be able to threaten them. Also beware and grow accustomed to some basic security best practices for defending yourself:

- [Create secure passwords](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice) (some complementary thoughts on strong passwords [here](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords)).
- [Use a password manager](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-using-password-managers-stay-safe-online).
- Enable two-factor authentication and [use your YubiKey](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-a-yubikey/).
- [Mind your communications](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/communicating-others).

Generally, however, since the main goal is to avoid links to your real identity, you should focus on _compartmentalization_. The level to which you commit to compartmentalizing parts of your life will, again, depend on your available time, skills, and budget.

The best case scenario, which you should strive for, is to have one separate device for each activity. That entails having one mobile device, one laptop, one phone number, one YubiKey (mabe here you'd want to have a second one as backup), and one of each device you might need for your pseudonymous identity –– and use them only for that single identity! Need a new identity? Then you'd need new devices.

But that is often not feasible, and rather than quitting it altogether, you should start small and build your way to the top. Striving for perfection is good if it means stimulating you to improve, but it can quickly become detrimental if it stops you from acting. Therefore, start with the good rather than the perfect.

In either case, you should compartmentalize as much as you realistically can at a given time.If you currently can't buy a new smartphone for your new identity, you can at least grab a new phone number, which is fairly cheap in most places, and a new VPN account with a different provider than your real identity's VPN. If your current phone supports two SIMs, for instance, you can use both numbers and both VPN accounts, switching VPN connections every time you need to connect to an app and based on the identity that app is associated with. I know, that can be rather cumbersome, but that's what a lower budget will often require.

Similarly, if you can't afford a new laptop, you can start by buying a VPN subscription as described previously in the guide and use the Tor Browser. However, that would only suffice for more basic threat models. You might then consider dedicating some time to flashing Tails onto a USB stick and learning the basics of the anonymity live operating system. That will enhance your setup right away, as Tails will enforce many best practices for you.

However, you _always_ need to remember that all these tools are [not perfect](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#AttacksOnOnionRouting) and that you might still be at risk. For instance, [Tor can do little for you if you use it wrong](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#Warning). It currently goes beyond the scope of this guide to discuss why and provide some steps one could take to mitigate it, but here are some [good and thorough guidelines (really read this!)](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/43485).
