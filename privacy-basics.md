# Privacy Basics

Privacy is a basic human right, often protected and ensured in the physical world, which has been a reality for the entirety of human existence. However, in the new digital world, privacy is seldom secured, and companies and governments often overextend their powers to the detriment of individual rights which get left behind as the differences between physical and online privacy encourage illegitimate data harvesting.

This document talks about the many different ways you might have been compromising on your digital privacy –– sometimes without your own knowledge or consent –– and discusses actions you can take to regain some of it. It highlights steps you can take today to diminish the footprint you leave online and reduce the overall risk of falling victim to online doxxing, stalking, coercion, and other undesirable consequences of browsing the internet.
